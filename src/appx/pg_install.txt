Overview
========

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that
uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store
and scale the most complicated data workloads.

PostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture,
reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the
dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently
deliver performant and innovative solutions.

PostgreSQL runs on **all major operating systems**, and is ACID
compliant.
