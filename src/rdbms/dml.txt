Creating new records
====================

When a table is created, it contains no data. Inserting data will populate
a table with values. Data is inserted one row at a time. You can also insert
multiple rows with a single command. But it impossible to insert something
that is not a complete row.

To create a new row use ``INSERT`` command.
