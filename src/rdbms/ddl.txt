Data Definition Language
************************

:abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` is a subset of SQL used for defining and
modifying the database structure. Understanding DDL is fundamental to working
with RDBMS. It allows you to define the structure of your data and make
necessary changes as your requirements evolve.

-   ``CREATE`` used to create new objects within a RDBMS
-   ``ALTER`` used to modify existing objects
-   ``DROP`` used to delete database objects
-   ``TRUNCATE`` used to remove all records from a table

Creating database roles
-----------------------

.. note::

    SQLite is a small database in a single file and it doesn't implement
    role based access to data. Any user who have access to DB file will
    have access to data within the database as well.

In RDBMS, roles are used to manage database permissions. They are an essential
part of database security and user management.

In PostgreSQL a **role** is an entity that can own database objects and have
database privileges; a role can be considered a *user*, a *group*, or both
depending on how it is used.

``CREATE ROLE`` statement defines a new database role.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE ROLE name;

This statement also can have options:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE ROLE name WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';

Options clarify if a role can login to the database server, connect to specific
databases, create other roles etc. The full list of options is available in the
official postgres documentation.
