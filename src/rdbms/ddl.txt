Data Definition Language
************************

:abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` is a subset of SQL used for defining and
modifying the database structure. Understanding DDL is fundamental to working
with RDBMS. It allows you to define the structure of your data and make
necessary changes as your requirements evolve.

-   ``CREATE`` used to create new objects within a RDBMS
-   ``ALTER`` used to modify existing objects
-   ``DROP`` used to delete database objects
-   ``TRUNCATE`` used to remove all records from a table

Create objects
==============

Creating database roles
-----------------------

.. note::

    SQLite is a small database in a single file and it doesn't implement
    role based access to data. Any user who have access to DB file will
    have access to data within the database as well.

In RDBMS, roles are used to manage database permissions. They are an essential
part of database security and user management.

In PostgreSQL a **role** is an entity that can own database objects and have
database privileges; a role can be considered a *user*, a *group*, or both
depending on how it is used.

``CREATE ROLE`` statement defines a new database role.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE ROLE name;

This statement also can have options:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE ROLE name WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';

Options clarify if a role can login to the database server, connect to specific
databases, create other roles etc. The full list of options is available in the
official postgres documentation.

Creating databases
------------------

``CREATE DATABASE`` statement creates a new PostgreSQL database. To create
a database, you must be a superuser or have ``CREATEDB`` privilege.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE DATABASE name;

Databases within a PostgreSQL server have owners. By default a user who creates
a database is assigned as its owner. To specify another user as a database
owner options may be used:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE DATABASE name OWNER role_name;

There are lots of options for this statement available in the official postgres
documentation.

Creating tables
---------------

To create a table, you use the aptly names ``CREATE TABLE`` command.
In this command you specify at least a name for the new table, the names of
the columns and the data type of each column.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE TABLE table_name
    (
        first_column  INTEGER,
        second_column NUMERIC,
        third_column  VARCHAR(32),
        fourth_column TEXT
    );

.. rubric:: Default value

Constraints also can be applied for columns while creating a table.
In this section, only most notable constraints will be described.

A column can be assigned a default value. When a new row is created and
no values are specified for some of the columns, those columns will be
filled with their respective default values. If no default value is declared
explicitly, the default value is the ``NULL`` value. This usually makes sense
because a null value can be considered to represent unknown data.

In a table definition the default values are listed after the data type.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE TABLE product
    (
        product_no INTEGER,
        name       TEXT
        price      NUMERIC DEFAULT 9.99
    );

The default value can be an expression, which will be evaluated whenever
the default value is inserted (**not when the table is created**).
A common example are timestamps columns representing the time a record was
created and a "serial number" generator.

.. code-block:: postgresql

    CREATE TABLE product
    (
        product_no INTEGER   DEFAULT nextval('product_no_seq'),
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );

There is a shorthand to generate serial numbers:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    product_no SERIAL
