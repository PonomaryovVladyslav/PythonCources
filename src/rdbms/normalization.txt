*******************************************************************************
                            Database Normalization
*******************************************************************************

Normalization is a process of organizing data in a database so that it is free
from redundancy and dependency. It helps to eliminate data inconsistencies and
anomalies, thereby improving data integrity. Normalization is a set of rules or
guidelines to design a database schema in such a way that it avoids data
duplication, data redundancy, and data inconsistency.

The main purpose of database normalization is to avoid complexities, eliminate
duplicates, and organize data in a consistent way. Normalization reduces data
redundancy and dependency, making the database more efficient, flexible, and
scalable. It also helps in maintaining data consistency and accuracy, and
ensures that updates and deletions are properly handled.

There are 6 **normal forms**, but this section focuses on the first 3 only,
since the commonest normal form you'll see out there is *3NF* (third normal
form).

Normalized tables are:

-   Easier to understand
-   Easier to enhance and extend
-   Protected from:

    -   insertion anomalies
    -   update anomalies
    -   deletion anomalies
